              <p>My parents were both born and raised in west Algeria in a town called Tiaret as well as my brother being born there. Most of our family is from there however
                some have immgrated to nearby European countries such as France, Belgium, etc. As most countries far from the west, Algeria experienced years of colonization by
                France mostly and about 45,000 Algerians died during a certain time period under the French reign. This is most commonly known as

              <p>Algeria experienced Arab colonialism which altered the very language we spoke for centuries. My contry is full of various tribes and people that no two people
                look alike. The <a href = "https://www.iwgia.org/en/algeria/708-indigenous-peoples-in-algeria#:~:text=The%20Amazigh%2C%20the%20Mozabite%20and,who%20did%20not%20speak%20Latin."
                target="_blank">IWGIA site</a> mentions the three major indeginous peoples in Algeria and are also present throughout the North African countries: The Amazigh, the Mozabite,
                and Tuarega people. They were able to maintain their customs much more than the rest of Algeria however this is not to say that the rest have lost was distringuses themselves
                from the rest of the countries in existence.</p>

              <a id="algerian_food_text"></a>
              <p>Our culture is filled with rich foods and clothing that brings light and color to our lives. The types of foods that are eaten across the country will primarly be sauce
                based and always eaten with some combination of potatoes and bread on the side. Contrary to many other North African and Middle Eastern countries, we do not have rice 
                based dishes. Our potatoes and bread are the substitute for that. Our dress will typically include fabrices of satin and velvet which are traditionally worn at special
                events and every day wear is of a very light fabric due to the high tempurature Algeria experiences throughout the year. </p>
