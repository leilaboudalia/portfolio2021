		<p> My name is Leila Boudalia and I am currently a first year student in the UMSI Masters of Information program with a strong intrest in UX design and reserach. I was first introduced to
        the School of Information through my brother who attended the University of Michigan as an undergraduate student and pursued the same degree I am pursuing at the master's level. Before coming
		to the University of Michigan, I pursued a degree within Economics and Business which was a drastic swtich from what I had been studying my first year and a half. I attended an early college
		program at the same university I pursued my degree in which allowed me the cushion to change my major while still being able to graduate early.

        </p>

		<p> Between my undergraduate degree and my masters degree, I was able to partake in an internship with an admissions office where I was introduced to various recruitment intiatives and outreach
		within a competitive school that has to intentially incorporate diversity initiatives into the recruitment process. It was an eye opening experience in which I was not onyl able to learn about
		the greater diversified population within the state of Michigan but I was also brought to light the technological disadvatages various populations face amidst seekers of higher education. At
		my previous instituion, I was a Tour Guide and a Guest Relations Coordinator within the Admissions Office and students from all sorts of backgrounds were the norm to come to the university
		and bring to light how accessible higher education is regardless of where you come from.
		</p>

		<p>I do enjoy doing a lot of community work within my own Muslim community within Ann Arbor. I attended an Islamic school when we first moved to Ann arbor about 10 years ago that is located
		on Plymouth Road (near North campus). The <a href = "http://www.mca-a2.org"target="_blank">Muslim Community Association of Ann Arbor</a> houses an Islamic School called <a href = "https://mia-aa.org/"
		target="_blank">Michigan Islamic Academy</a> where I attended my middle school years there. This school and mosque are a strong portion of my life that provied the foundation of the person I am today and what
		I value most in my life as a young Muslim American. I spent most of my undergraduate years giving back to my community through joining youth organizations, mentoring young girls in the community,
		and organizing events for the community at large.
		</p>

		<p>I mentioned previously that I had only been in Ann Arbor for about 10 years and in Michigan for about 15 years. To get to the root of who I am and where I come from, I was born in Pittsburgh,
		Pennsylvania. As I remember my childhood, it was filled with many outdoor events during the warmer and colder months alike. Everything was within walking distance or a short commute away
		which is something I wish I had here in Michigan. My parents came from Algeria at a very young age when my oldest sibling was about 5 and they spent their years there getting to know America and
		building a life they came here to do. Both of my parents were driven in their educational endeavors and pursued degrees as soon as they were able to. They are the reason that education is something
		we strive to perfect in our home.
